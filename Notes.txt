Things I need the systme to do:

Motor:

    Functionality to fully charge the system to 100 psi.
        Will probably need to see how long the system can stay pressurized at this psi. Stability test.
        Will also need active pressure monitoring during this process.

    Detect when there is a leak, and motor should not activate when pressure is detected to be below a specified level.

    Turn on when system is below a specified PSI level.
        Need logic to detect that the system psi is increasing so the motor doesn't run indefinitely. 

    Logic to detect when the motor shuts off because pressure limit has been reached. 
        This would allow us to be able to better tell when the system is fully pressurized. And we can


Pressure Transducer:
    Logic to simply read the transducer values every loop, and if they are under a certain pressure, pressurize the system again. This function should be standalone, should
    even be able to be ran at any point from another function.

    Logic to detect a catastrophic leak in the system.

Communications:
    Pressure and State logging over Wifi to track performance of the devices.
    Error logging to a server that sends notifications via phone messages or emails or something. 


Nozzles:
    The turn-on time needs to be characterized. I realize the spray is not 
    at 100% effectiveness for a few seconds as the water needs a moment to push past the air
    and unpressurized water in the system near the nozzles from the last run. It isnt as bad when 
    pressurizing one set of nozzles at a time though, so this may not be a big issue. Just keep in 
    mind of it though. THAT and we need to understand for how long we can spray with 5 nozzles for our system from 100psi to 80psi (or whichever lower end pressure)
    Solution for this might be to just bring the solenoids closer to the nozzles.

    Also check how long a set of nozzles can run on a full charge of water at 100 psi.

    Full function to do a full cycle of all four sides of nozzles. 
        i.e: (Continuous pressure monitoring)
            1. Activate Motor until system pressurized to 100 psi
Loop start  2. Activate Solenoid A for x seconds. Check PSI.
            3. If psi below a certain threshold, interrupt cycle and repressurize system
Loop End    4. If pressure between 90 and 100 psi, then we're good and can loop back to step 2
